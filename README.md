# Personal Financial Management
Hi guys. I am developing an app that will bring about a balance sheet with assets/liabilities, income/expenses, and budgeting features.
Assets are described as things that add value, such as cash and savings.
Liabilities are described as things that detract from value, namely debt obligations.
Income is money taken in from a source.
Expenses is money taken out to pay.
Feel free to suggest features for this app.
