# Personal Financial Management
Hi guys. I am developing an app that will bring about a balance sheet with assets/liabilities, income/expenses, and budgeting features. <br>
Assets are described as things that add value, such as cash and savings. <br>
Liabilities are described as things that detract from value, namely debt obligations. <br>
Income is money taken in from a source. <br>
Expenses is money taken out to pay. <br>
Feel free to suggest features for this app. <br>
